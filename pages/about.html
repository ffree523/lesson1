                    Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and a German-American mother.
                    <br>
                    He was adopted shortly after his birth.
                    <br>
                    Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.
                    <br>
                    In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.
                    <br>
                    He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.
                    <br>
                    A year later, the duo gained fame and wealth with production and sale of the Apple II,
                    <br>
                    one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
                    <br>
                    Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979,
                    <br>
                    which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI).
                    <br>
                    This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983,
                    <br>
                    followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI.
                    <br>
                    The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of
                    <br>
                    the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
